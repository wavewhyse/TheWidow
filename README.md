Hello!

The Widow is my (wavewhyseðŸŒ ) original character mod for Slay the Spire.
If you don't know how to install one of those, first grab Mod The Spire off the Steam Workshop to get started. You'll also need BaseMod and StSLib (both also available on the Workshop) for Widow to work. Once you have those, grab TheWidow.jar from the latest release and drop it into the 'mods' folder in your Slay the Spire directory.

This mod adds a new character to the game: The Widow, a transhuman cyborg who is constantly modifying and upgrading her spider-like body. She specializes in temporarily upgrading her cards during combat, as well as Beta cards that can be upgraded infinitely. She also can generate potions, apply powerful new debuffs, and surround herself in Web to reduce incoming damage. The Widow's design is intended to be very close to the base game, and there aren't any crazy new mechanics to manage. The mod includes (eventually) a full suite of 75 cards, potions, relics, and art assets, all exclusive to The Widow herself. 

THE WIDOW IS CURRENTLY VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS!! Design and balance are absolutely not final and are both changing daily. Any feedback and suggestions on this character are absolutely welcomed and encouraged!! You can reach me as wavewhyseðŸŒ #9908 on Discord, or in the modding channels on the official Slay the Spire Discord server. Once I have original art assets for everything and all of the cards/relics/potiens are implemented and balanced to an acceptable degree, she will be uploaded to the Steam Workshop, but for now she is only on GitHub. New releases are frequent, so check back often!

The Widow's code is based off The Default, a tutorial mod that provides a template and base for StS mods. You can grab it here: https://github.com/Gremious/StS-DefaultModBase It is extremely good and makes getting a start in modding a piece of cake. Huge thanks to Gremious, without the Default this mod probably would not exist.
